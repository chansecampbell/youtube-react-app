* To add to the readme 
- Added bootstrap grid only for structure, but wanted freedom over styling
- Added gulp tasks early in the build to precompile the js and sass
- Started out with views, base components etc folders for the js but stripped it back after realising that the solution could be done more simply without using redux and react router for such a small task.
- Linting, accessibility etc


* To add to codebase:
- Multi line ellipsis
- Mobile restacking of elements
- Basic JS tests
- Linting
